# TRAVELLER 

### An application that enables travellers to store and organize travel destination recommendations (hotel, restaurant, activity, etc.)

The Traveller App allows users to keep track of travel recommendations all in one place. Users can add relevant trips including completed, upcoming, and bucket list trips as well as add recommendations for future reference. Users can easily document any notes or recommendations for each trip as well as delete any recommendations they no longer find useful. This is the perfect app to store the best hotel, restaurant, and activity recommendations from past vacations as well as store miscellaneous recommendations received from friends for future travel. This app provides a single point of reference for all travel recommendations making it easily accessible when friends and family inevitably ask for travel recommendations as well as when you are finally ready to plan that dream vacation.
